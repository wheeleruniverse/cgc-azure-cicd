# Cloud Guru Challenge: Azure CI/CD with Ruby on Rails

This project is a response to the A Cloud Guru challenge to build a continuously integrated global Azure web app. The goal was to create a web application with a CI/CD pipeline that is globally performant and protected against online attacks.

-----

## 🚀 Features

  * **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** The project uses Azure DevOps and a YAML pipeline to automatically build, test, and deploy the application.
  * **Globally Performant:** Azure Front Door is used to accelerate the application at the edge and provide load balancing.
  * **Secure:** The application is protected against online attacks.
  * **Scalable:** The application is designed to be scalable to meet the needs of a global audience.

-----

## 💻 Tech Stack

  * **Application:** Ruby on Rails
  * **Cloud Provider:** Microsoft Azure
  * **Database:** Azure Cosmos DB
  * **CI/CD:** Azure DevOps
  * **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** ARM Templates

-----

## 🏛️ Architecture

The application is deployed to Azure App Service and uses Azure Cosmos DB for data storage. Azure Front Door is used to provide a global entry point to the application and to accelerate content delivery. Azure DevOps is used to build, test, and deploy the application.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have the following:

  * An Azure account
  * An Azure DevOps account
  * A GitHub account

Once you have these accounts, you can clone the repository and follow the instructions in the `azure-pipelines.yml` file to deploy the application.

## 🚀 Deployment

The `azure-pipelines.yml` file contains the CI/CD pipeline for this project. The pipeline has the following stages:

1.  **Build:** The build stage builds the Ruby on Rails application.
2.  **Test:** The test stage runs the tests for the application.
3.  **Deploy:** The deploy stage deploys the application to the "staging" slot of the Azure App Service.
4.  **Swap:** The swap stage swaps the "staging" and "production" slots of the Azure App Service.
